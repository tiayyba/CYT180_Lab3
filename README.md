# CYT180 – Week 3 Lab  
## Intro to Hadoop & HDFS for Cybersecurity Data Analytics (Google Colab)

This lab introduces Hadoop in **pseudo‑distributed mode** on Google Colab and walks you through loading and analyzing **cybersecurity datasets** using HDFS + MapReduce/Streaming.  
**Concepts come from Week 3 slides:**
- HDFS blocks, replication, NameNode/DataNode roles, read/write paths, and data locality

Pseudo‑distributed Hadoop normally requires Java configuration and passwordless SSH as noted in the official Hadoop single‑node setup. (https://barrelsofdata.com/apache-hadoop-pseudo-distributed-mode)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Install Hadoop in pseudo‑distributed mode on Google Colab.  
- Create and interact with HDFS.  
- Load cybersecurity logs (Zeek, Windows EVTX → CSV, small NetFlow‑like).  
- Run HDFS commands and Hadoop MapReduce/Streaming jobs.  
- Explain NameNode (metadata-only) and DataNode (data blocks) responsibilities. [1](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/logs/index.html)
